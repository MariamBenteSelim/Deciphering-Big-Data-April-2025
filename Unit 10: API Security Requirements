Security Requirements Specification
API Chosen: OpenWeatherMap API
Use Case: Python program accessing weather data and saving it as JSON/XML/SQL for analysis or sharing

1. Authentication & API Key Management
- Requirement: An API key must be used to access the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Security Risk: If the API key is exposed publicly (e.g., in GitHub), unauthorized access or data overuse may occur.
- Mitigation:
- Store API keys in environment variables or external config files (not in the code directly)
- Use .gitignore to prevent accidental uploads of keys
- Rotate keys regularly and monitor usage

2. HTTPS Usage
- Requirement: All data exchanges must use HTTPS instead of HTTP.
- Security Risk: Without HTTPS, data can be intercepted during transmission.
- Mitigation:
- Always confirm the API URL starts with https://
- Use libraries like requests which default to secure connections

3. Data Validation & File Storage
- Requirement: Retrieved data (JSON/XML) must be validated before saving or inserting into SQL
- Security Risk: Invalid or unexpected data may corrupt files or databases
- Mitigation:
- Use Python checks (e.g., try/except, schema validation tools like jsonschema)
- Ensure XML/JSON structures match expected formats
- Sanitize inputs before writing to SQL to prevent SQL injection

4. SQL Interaction Safety
- Requirement: Use parameterized queries when saving to SQL
- Security Risk: Improper query formatting can allow SQL injection attacks
- Mitigation:
- Use Python libraries like sqlite3 or SQLAlchemy which support safe queries
- Avoid directly inserting user inputs into SQL strings

5. Rate Limiting & Usage Monitoring
- Requirement: Respect the APIâ€™s rate limits to avoid service disruption
- Security Risk: Abuse or unintended high-frequency access can lead to bans or broken systems
- Mitigation:
- Check the OpenWeatherMap API documentation for request limits
- Add delay (time.sleep()) or retry logic to scripts if needed
- Monitor logs to detect unusual usage patterns

Tools and Techniques Used
- Python Modules: requests, os, json, xml.etree.ElementTree, sqlite3
- File Formats Managed: JSON and XML for storage; SQL for structured data insertion
- Best Practices Followed: API key protection, validation before saving, safe SQL interaction
