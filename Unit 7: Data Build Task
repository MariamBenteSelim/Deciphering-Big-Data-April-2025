Building a Relational Database System After Normalisation
After normalising the student dataset to Third Normal Form (3NF), a relational database system was designed using multiple linked tables. This helped organise the data properly and demonstrate how primary and foreign keys can be used to connect related information.

Tables Created
- Students Table
- Primary Key: StudentNumber
- Contains student details such as name, date of birth, exam score, and support status
- Courses Table
- Primary Key: CourseID
- Contains course names (e.g. Maths, Biology, Music)
- ExamBoards Table
- Primary Key: BoardID
- Contains board names (e.g. AQA, EdExcel)
- Teachers Table
- Primary Key: TeacherID
- Contains teacher names
- Enrolments Table
- Primary Key: Combination of StudentNumber, CourseID
- Foreign Keys: Links to StudentNumber, CourseID, BoardID, TeacherID
- Shows which student is studying which course with which teacher and exam board

Referential Integrity Testing
- Foreign key constraints were applied to ensure that links between tables were valid.
- Test entries were added and checked to confirm that:
- Students could only be linked to valid course, teacher, and exam board entries.
- Invalid or unmatched references were blocked by the database.

Summary of Results
By completing this task:
- The principles of relational design were applied in practice.
- The use of primary keys ensured unique records.
- The use of foreign keys enforced consistency between related tables.
- Referential integrity was maintained, preventing errors or mismatches in the database.
