Introduction
The purpose of this evaluation is to reflect on progress from the initial project proposal in Unit 6 to the final submission in Unit 11, considering tutor feedback and self-assessment. 
The focus is on improvements achieved, gaps that remained, and lessons learned.

Strengths of Unit 6 Proposal
Well-written and structured, within the required word limit.
Demonstrated clear understanding of database principles and application.
Included academic references in Harvard style.
Project objectives were articulated concisely.

Areas of Weakness in Unit 6
Limited critical analysis: Technology decisions (PostgreSQL, Supabase) were presented without comparison or justification.
Unclear use of CSV files in the context of relational database forms.
Limited references (around 12), reducing support for theoretical discussions.

Improvements in Unit 11
Increased references to approximately 20, improving academic support.
Added implementation details such as PostgreSQL integration with Supabase and visualisation using Power BI.
Maintained Harvard referencing style throughout.

Remaining Gaps in Unit 11
Criticality still limited: No comprehensive comparison between PostgreSQL and alternatives like MySQL, Oracle, or MS SQL.
Minimal discussion of NoSQL databases despite relevance.

Structural issues: Repetition of technology details in both executive summary and main report.

Word count: Final report reached 1,826 words, below the required 2,000.

Content gaps: Limited explanation of the data management pipeline (ETL process).
GDPR compliance not addressed, despite data privacy importance.

Lessons Learned
Greater emphasis is required on critical justification of technology choices, supported by academic evidence.
Avoidance of redundancy in content would create space for in-depth analysis.
Adequate planning is essential to meet word count requirements without sacrificing quality.
Compliance with regulations such as GDPR and detailed discussion of data handling processes must be included to demonstrate best practice.

Conclusion
Progress was evident between Unit 6 and Unit 11, particularly in technical detail and referencing. However, critical depth, structural efficiency, and regulatory considerations remained underdeveloped. 
Future work will prioritise structured argumentation, theoretical comparisons, and comprehensive coverage of compliance requirements.
