From a professional perspective, this project may not have an immediate application in my current role as an audit manager. 
However, it has reinforced key transferable skills that are essential in my profession, such as attention to detail, structured problem-solving, and evidence-based reasoning. 
The requirement to research academic sources and apply correct referencing has also improved my ability to validate information, which directly supports professional credibility and compliance-focused work.
On a personal level, the project has been highly valuable.
As someone from a non-technical background, engaging with concepts such as relational databases, cloud platforms, and data visualisation tools provided an opportunity to learn entirely new skills. 
This experience aligns with my long-term goal of expanding technical knowledge and adapting to an increasingly digital environment. 
It has also encouraged a mindset of continuous learning, persistence, and analytical thinkingâ€”qualities that are beneficial for both academic progress and future career aspirations.
